## Space Debris Classification 


## Overview:
- The Space Debris Classification Project is a project with an aim to create a machine learning model that will enable the classification of space objects as either debris or non-debris. This project follows a typical lifecycle that is required for a complete end -end data science project. THe project lifecycle consists of data cleaning and minor feature engineering, EDA , Data-PreProcessing, Modeling and the model deployment.
## Project Objective.
- The objective of this project is to create a model that accurately classifies space debris based on the several factors. By using cutting -edge machine learning techniques to accurately identify space debris, we can promote more safe missions ,and decrease risk of collissions for satellites.
